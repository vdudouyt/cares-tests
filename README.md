cares-tests
=============
A standalone c-ares testing suite derived from original implementation

## Synopsis
```
$ ./arestest libcares.so     # Test original c-ares
$ ./arestest libcares_rs.so  # Test cares-rs
```

## Notes
* Tests are almost unchanged, but harness is heavily modified
* Updates are performed by syncing ares-test-***.cc files from original implementation
